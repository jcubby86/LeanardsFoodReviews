                   Hello everybody, I'm Leonard. I'm here today to review Let's Potato Chips. $1.79 at Kroger's. Ahh. Can't get this sucker open. Ha! There we are. Now, I've already had some of these, but, let's see! MMMMM!!! Crispy! Salty, not too greasy! That one's shaped like a duck! Well, I guess that's definitely a buy! That's it. Let's Potato Chips are good, and they're a buy.
